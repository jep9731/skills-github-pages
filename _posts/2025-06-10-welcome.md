Welcome! I'm glad you're here.

I'm a **clinical research professional** with over five years of experience in **neuroimaging** and in conducting psychological and neurodegenerative studies. I work at the **Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease** at **Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine**, where I support cutting-edge research into how the brain changes in aging and dementia.

### 🧠 What I Do

My day-to-day work focuses on neuroimaging data and how we can use it to identify early markers of **Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD)**. This includes:

- **Processing and analyzing** structural and functional **MRI** and **PET** imaging data.
- Identifying **biomarkers** for neurodegenerative diseases.
- **Optimizing workflows** for neuroimaging pipelines using tools like **FreeSurfer**, **FSL**, and **SPM**.
- Collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to translate research questions into **actionable analyses**.

### 📊 What I’m Learning

I’m currently expanding my skillset by pursuing a **Master’s in Data Science** at **Northwestern University’s School of Professional Studies**. My focus is on applying **analytics**, **machine learning**, and **AI** to neuroimaging data.

Here’s what I’m building into my data science toolkit:
- Learning **Python** (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn), **R**, and **SQL** to automate analyses and find patterns in high-dimensional brain data.
- Exploring **AI/ML applications** to neuroimaging, including preprocessing pipelines and predictive models for **cognitive decline**.

### 🔍 Why This Matters

I believe that **data-driven approaches** have the power to revolutionize how we diagnose and treat neurodegenerative diseases. My background gives me a unique perspective, one that combines clinical research rigor with emerging computational tools.

By integrating neuroimaging science with modern data analysis, we can move toward more personalized, precise understanding of the aging brain.
